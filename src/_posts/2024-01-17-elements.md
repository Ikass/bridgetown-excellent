Here's a sample blog post in Markdown that showcases different vanilla HTML elements:

# My Blog Post

## Introduction

Welcome to my blog post! In this post, I'll be showcasing different vanilla HTML elements that you can use in your Bridgetown static site generator demo website.

## Headings

You can use headings to structure your content. Here are some examples:

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

## Blockquotes

You can use blockquotes to highlight important information. Here's an example:

## Emphasis

You can use emphasis to draw attention to certain words or phrases. Here are some examples:

_Italic_

**Bold**

**_Bold and Italic_**

## Lists

You can use lists to organize your content. Here are some examples:

### Unordered List

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Ordered List

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3

## Code

You can use code blocks to display code snippets. Here's an example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Website</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>This is some sample text.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```
